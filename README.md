# DEMO COUNTER

## To use:

Go to http://demos.submitteddenied.com/admin.html in your browser. Create an account (or log in).

Where it asks for your "First & last name", just put anything you want (eg, `submitteddenied`)

Once you get to the admin page. Click increment and decrement to control the counter.

In OBS, create a Browser source. Set it's url to http://demos.submitteddenied.com/ and then add `?` followed by the name you chose above (eg `?submitteddenied`).

Enjoy!
